## 1 Title: Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction
## Description:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster, using the classic Titanic dataset.
### Data Acquisition: 
Download the Titanic dataset from a reliable source like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
## Software Requirements:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn). You can install them using 
```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn```
## Project Structure:
### data: 
This folder will contain the downloaded Titanic dataset (e.g., titanic.csv).
notebooks: This folder will contain Jupyter Notebooks (or Python scripts) for your analysis (e.g., titanic_data_set.ipynb).
## Resources:

## 2 Title:Sales Prediction with Python
This repository implements sales prediction models using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The goal is to forecast future sales based on historical data and relevant factors influencing customer behavior.
## Description:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict sales, using the prediction dataset.

## Process:

## Data Acquisition:
Identify and download a sales dataset containing historical sales information, product details, and potentially marketing campaign data. Sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository might be helpful.
## Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Use pandas to analyze the data, understand its structure, and identify missing values or inconsistencies.
Utilize visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore relationships between features and sales.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values (imputation or removal) and encoding categorical variables.
## Training:
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for sales prediction, such as:
Linear Regression: For capturing linear relationships between features and sales.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the chosen model(s) on the training set, optimizing hyperparameters for best performance.
## Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model(s) on the unseen testing set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the best results.


## 3 Title: Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## Description:

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris flower dataset, a widely used introductory classification task, is employed for training and evaluation.

## Features:
Utilizes the pandas,scikit-learn library for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
I Use K-means Cluster
Supports various classification algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
