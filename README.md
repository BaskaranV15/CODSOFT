## DATA SCIENCE
## Title: Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction
## Description:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster, using the classic Titanic dataset.
### Data Acquisition: 
Download the Titanic dataset from a reliable source like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
## Software Requirements:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn). You can install them using 
```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn```
## Project Structure:
### data: 
This folder will contain the downloaded Titanic dataset (e.g., titanic.csv).
notebooks: This folder will contain Jupyter Notebooks (or Python scripts) for your analysis (e.g., titanic_data_set.ipynb).
